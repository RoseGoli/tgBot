 * @class SendChatAction
 * @description Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status). Returns True on success.
 * We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a noticeable amount of time to arrive.
 *
 * @property int|string $chat_id Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername)
 * @property string $action Type of action to broadcast. Choose one, depending on what the user is about to receive: typing for text messages, upload_photo for photos, record_video or upload_video for videos, record_voice or upload_voice for voice notes, upload_document for general files, choose_sticker for stickers, find_location for location data, record_video_note or upload_video_note for video notes.

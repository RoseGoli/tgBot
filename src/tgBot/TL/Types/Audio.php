 * @class Audio
 * @description This object represents an audio file to be treated as music by the Telegram clients.
 *
 * @method string getFileId() Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file
 * @method string getFileUniqueId() Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can't be used to download or reuse the file.
 * @method int getDuration() Duration of the audio in seconds as defined by sender
 * @method string getPerformer() Optional. Performer of the audio as defined by sender or by audio tags
 * @method string getTitle() Optional. Title of the audio as defined by sender or by audio tags
 * @method string getFileName() Optional. Original filename as defined by sender
 * @method string getMimeType() Optional. MIME type of the file as defined by sender
 * @method int getFileSize() Optional. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value.
 * @method PhotoSize getThumb() Optional. Thumbnail of the album cover to which the music file belongs

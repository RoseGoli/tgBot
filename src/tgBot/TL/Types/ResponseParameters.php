 * @method int getMigrateToChatId() Optional. The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the specified identifier. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
 * @method int getRetryAfter() Optional. In case of exceeding flood control, the number of seconds left to wait before the request can be repeated
 *
